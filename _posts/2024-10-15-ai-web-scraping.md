The [L.O.P.S. Web Scraper](https://github.com/creativepolymath/LOPSWebScraper) is a practical tool that combines [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to offer a straightforward solution for web scraping. This project integrates artificial intelligence and automation to simplify data collection and processing, making it a solid choice for tasks that require efficient and intelligent data extraction. The ultimate goal is to easily collect data for Data Analysis [portfolio projects](https://github.com/creativepolymath/).

Combining Langchain, Python, and Ollama for Smart Scraping

L.O.P.S. relies on Langchain’s community plugins to connect with Ollama’s LLM and manage the scraping templates through core prompts. Python provides essential functionality, with pandas handling data structures and custom-built functions that automate repetitive processes. One of the highlights is the self-hosted Ollama server running Llama3.2:3b, giving users the flexibility of local AI processing with the added benefit of privacy and reduced latency.

User-Friendly Setup with Streamlit and Chrome Integration

The Streamlit interface ensures that inputs, outputs, and theming are easy to manage, offering a smooth user experience without the need for complex coding. The project also emphasizes using the latest Chromedriver.exe from Chrome Developer Downloads to ensure compatibility with modern web pages. Whether you’re gathering product data, tracking trends, or extracting information for research, L.O.P.S. provides a reliable way to handle these tasks. The final function is outputting the data as a CSV file, ready "almost" for use in Excel.
