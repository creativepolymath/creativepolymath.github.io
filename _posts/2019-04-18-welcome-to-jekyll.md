You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

```r
file_path <- "./output_CSV/amd_stock_data_clean.csv"  # Define the file name and path
write.csv(amd_data_clean, file = file_path, row.names = FALSE)  # Write the data frame to a CSV file
print(paste("Cleaned data has been exported to", file_path))  # Print confirmation message
```
